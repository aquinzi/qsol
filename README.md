QSol
====

Solitaires "database". Recreating/updating <http://aquinzi.com/qsol/>, using:

  * PHP (frontend) and Python (backend)
  * YAML for storage and JSON for search.

Basically, it just an experiment to use YAML and JSON instead of a database, and creating a very basic "wiki" for the information using GitHub.

In the ``master`` branch there's nothing yet, be sure to check the ``cooking`` branch. It's in the very early stages, so don't expect much.
